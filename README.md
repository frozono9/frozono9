### About Me

I’m a multidisciplinary engineer with a background in **Mechatronics and Robotics**, currently pursuing a **BSc in Artificial Intelligence Engineering** at **UPC Barcelona**.  
I’ve worked at **Sony AI (Zurich & Tokyo)** developing robotic and sensing prototypes, and I design **AI-driven systems** that merge **mechanical precision** with **cognitive intelligence**.

Beyond engineering, I’ve served as a **technical consultant for magicians like Dynamo and El Mago Pop**, creating interactive illusions powered by real technology.  
I believe magic and AI share the same goal — turning the impossible into something you can experience.
